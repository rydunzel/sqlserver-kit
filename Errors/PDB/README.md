This section contains PowerShell scripts which automate the download and extraction of `.PDB` files corresponding to major releases of SQL Server.

For running any of these scripts, please note the following:
- You must run them within PowerShell, preferably within Windows
- You must have Internet access from the machine running the PowerShell script
- You might want to replace the $outputFolder placeholder with a different folder path (for example, `N:\sqlsymbols\SQL2016SP1`)
- The script will automatically create the folder where the downloaded PDB files are stored.
